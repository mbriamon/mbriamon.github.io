User Perspective: To the user the program asks them to choose what function they would like to perform on the two numbers. The user chooses a number between 1 and 5 to decide what they want to do next. Then the user is prompted to input 2 numbers. After inputting these numbers the user sees an output that calculated those 2 numbers that the user inputed as they asked from what they entered as the first number. 

Internally: This program works with 6 functions. The first function called was the menu function. This printed the menu options and asked the user to enter their choice. The second function was get_numbers(). This function asked the user to input a number. The remaining 4 functions were: get_add, get_subtract, get_multiply, and get_divide. These functions performed the mathmatical calculations. In my main code, I first created variables: choice, num1, num2, and answer. Choice was used to catch the value menu() returned. num1 and num2 were used to catch the values from get_numbers. Answer was created to catch the number returned by the mathmatical functions. Then the code entered a while loop, so that the user could calculate as many things as they wanted. There were if, else if, and else statements inside the loop to determine how the program would continue based on the number entered in the menu() function. Then each code block called the get_numbers() function twice, to catch 2 numbers. Then the proper math function was called, and then the answer was printed. When the user enters 5, the code prints "Good bye!" and the loop breaks. 

Verification: I verifed that my program was working correctly by calculating the values on my calculator. I would input a choice value, and then choose 2 numbers to calculate. Then I would perform that same function on my calculator to check that the program was returning the correct values.
