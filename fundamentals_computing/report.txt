User Perspecive: From the user, it looks like the program prints a visual display of a function. It gives the x and y values of the function and a bar graph, that is proportional in length to y. The program also displays the x and y values at the end of the program. 
Internally: The program works by calculating the given function. I assigned this calculation to a variable. This value was a double data type, so the number would be an decimal. Then I used the round function, to make this decimal an integer. The program then entered a for loop to print "#" the number of times to match the rounded number. After it reached the end of a line, it would print a new line. The function hada nested for loop. The first loop to print the x and y values, and the second to print the correct number of #. Variables,  minimum and maximum, were initialized before the for loops, and set to 0. Then there was a check inside the loop. If a new max became or a new min, then this y value would replace the existing value in the maximum and minimum variables. There were also  minimumposition and maximumposition variables created to hold the x values of the found max and min. These were printed after the function exited bboth for loops.
Verified: I verified the function by calculating the values by hand. I just used my calculator to calculate first 20 values. This allowed me to check the values in the x,y table. Then I rounded all the numbers I calculated and counted the number of "#". Since these rounded numbers equaled the number of "#" at each position, I new the output was correct.
