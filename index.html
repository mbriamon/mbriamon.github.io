                <p class="section-content">Hey! My name is Mary Briamonte. I am a sophomore at the University of Notre Dame majoring in computer engineering and minioring in Engineering Corporate Practice. I am from Holmdel, New Jersey.
Academic Interests: coding, maybe research one day, data science
Professional Interests: I think I want to work in the entertainment industry. I love music and movies, so hopefully I will do something with that one day. I currently work for FIM and ND Studios to film the athletic events on campus. And I am also an admissions tour guide. 
Other Interests: I love to bake. Hopefully, I will open my own bakery one day. I am on the Irish Dance Team here, which is lots of fun. I play intramural volleyball, flag football, and I am technically on the Welsh Fam basketball team, but I am very bad. I want to see the world, so I hope that one day I get a job that involves travel. My favorite movie is Ferris Buellerâ€™s Day Off.
